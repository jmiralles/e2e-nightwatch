Scenario: Initial search

Given I'm in the main page

| Alicante | Almer√≠a | NEXT_WEEK | 1 |

Then I get available flight

## Instructions

```
npm install
npm run nightwatch
```

Tests will run in chrome and when finished a html report should automatically open in browser.

Sometimes npm run nightwatch fails. Trying again should do the trick.
